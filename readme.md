# Swamp Game

Welcome to the Swamp Game! This Java-based game features Hek, a character navigating through a swamp filled with enemies. Your goal is to move Hek around and deal with various enemies, each with its own unique behavior.

## Game Features

- **Character**: Hek, the main character, has two moods:
  - **Passive Mood**: Hek is less aggressive and appears in green.
  - **Grumpy Mood**: Hek is more powerful and turns orange.

- **Enemies**:

  Enemies enter the game from the top-left corner and move randomly around the swamp.
